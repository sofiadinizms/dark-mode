## Concept
A simple portfoloio website for an imaginary person, with dark and light mode

## Stack
My current goal is to revisit the basics of web development, creating a strong foundation on CSS, HTML and JavaScript. With every subject that I've studied throughout my life, be it tech related or not, one premisse 
has remained true: **a strong foundations is the most important part when learning something new**. For this reason, I'm revisitind the basics of web development and decided to use pure **CSS, HTML and JavaScript** on the creation of this project

## How to run
If you would like to run this on your computer and try it for yourself, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open your file manager (Finder for MacOS, for example)
3. Click on the HTML file
4. The file should open as a web page on your main browser
5. Click on the moon icon and watch the website change from light to darkmode :)
